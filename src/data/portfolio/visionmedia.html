              The VisionMedia Digital Signage platform has over 1,500 set top box installations, each of which 
              connect to the Qooxdoo-based web services to download media and instructions.  The Qooxdoo based
              control panel administers the content and facilities for each site, and the owners of each site 
              (of which there are over 4,000 users) log in via a separate Qooxdoo based members application to 
              customise the content broadcast to their screen.
